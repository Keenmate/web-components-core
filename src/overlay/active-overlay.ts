/**
 * Cross-component "one overlay open at a time" coordination.
 *
 * Floating overlays across every KM component (multiselect dropdown, daterangepicker
 * calendar, a future menu, …) — and any *external* popover (a Svelte component, a
 * plain-DOM widget, another framework) — cooperate so that opening one dismisses all
 * the others. There is exactly one coordination channel: a `document` CustomEvent
 * `km-overlay-activate` (namespaced like `km-log`), carrying `{ source, group }`.
 * Everyone routes through it, so **nothing has to import this module to participate**
 * — pure DOM code can both trigger and observe the same behaviour.
 *
 * ## Groups
 * Overlays coordinate only *within a group*. Register with a `group` to scope a set of
 * controls so they dismiss each other but leave other groups untouched — e.g. a toolbar
 * of pickers that shouldn't close a sidebar of pickers. Overlays registered with no
 * group share the default (ungrouped) group. Opening a group-`A` overlay dismisses only
 * other group-`A` overlays. {@link dismissAllOverlays}() (no argument) crosses every
 * group via the {@link ALL_GROUPS} wildcard.
 *
 * ## Nesting (parents)
 * Overlays form a tree: a dropdown inside a modal, a context menu inside the dropdown, a
 * submenu… Opening a child must not dismiss its ancestors. The detail carries an optional
 * `ancestors` list — the sources NOT to dismiss — and participants are skipped when their
 * source is in it. Core fills it in for you: give {@link registerOverlay} the overlay's
 * panel element (`getElement`) and {@link OverlayHandle.activate} the element that opened
 * it (`trigger`); the parent is the nearest OPEN overlay whose panel contains the trigger
 * (across shadow roots), found in a page-wide registry every copy of core shares. Closing
 * an overlay ({@link OverlayHandle.deactivate}) dismisses the overlays opened inside it,
 * deepest first. External code may pass `ancestors` itself; an activation without it
 * behaves exactly as before.
 *
 * Direction A — dismiss KM overlays from outside code:
 *   document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('km-overlay-activate', { detail: { source: myId, group: 'A' } }))
 *   // or, if you import core: notifyOverlayActivated(myId, 'A')
 *
 * Direction B — have your own popover dismissed when a KM overlay opens:
 *   document.addEventListener('km-overlay-activate', (e) => {
 *     const { source, group, ancestors = [] } = e.detail;
 *     if (source !== myId && !ancestors.includes(myId) && group === myGroup) closeMyPopover();
 *   })
 *   // or, if you import core: onOverlayActivated((source, group) => { … })
 *
 * `source` is an opaque identity used only for `===` self-comparison so an opener never
 * dismisses itself. Registered participants get a private token automatically; external
 * callers pass their own (a string, an object, anything).
 *
 * SSR-safe: with no `document`, registration still works but activation is a no-op.
